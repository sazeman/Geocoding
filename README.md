# Geocoding

This is a script to be used in ArcGIS for geocoding addresses.
It improves upon ArcGIS's geocoding tool by separating the matched 
from the unmatched addresses after geocoding.
The matched addresses are added as a layer to the map,
while the unmatched addresses are exported to a .csv

This example requires the ArcGIS tutorial data: customers.csv and Atlanta address locator.
